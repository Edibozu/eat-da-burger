# Eat-da-Burger

## Description

Eat-da-Burger is a culmination of the skills we have leanred in the last few weeks, which include MySQL, Express and Handlebars. While simple in it's design, this applications requires highly-detailed code, across several file types. The user will be able to add a new burger from a submit from, and once added, they can "devour" it. WHen this happens, the burger will go from the left side of the screen to the right. When ann burgers get devoured, the user can always add more with the submit form.
